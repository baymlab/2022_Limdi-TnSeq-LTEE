    "## Goal of the notebook: calculate fitness effect of insertion mutations in DM25 and write DFE data to file\n",

    "Input Data:\n",
    "- mutant trajectories: number of counts at each TA site at every time point for each population. \n",
    "\n",
    "### PLEASE DOWNLOAD DATA FROM ZENODO INTO DATA FOLDER, FILES ARE TOO LARGE FOR GITHUB\n",
    "\n",
    "Analysis Approach:\n",
    "- Calculate fitness effects of disrupting genes by linear fit to log frequency vs time. Average over TA sites in the interior of the gene. (require at least x number of TA sites for which we calculate fitness)\n",
    "- If no fitness is calculated, set value as -1\n",
    "- Correct the fitness effect of each gene with an internal control: the average effect of disrupting pseudogenes\n",
    "- Do a pairwise comparison of the ancestor vs each population: if there is no fitness calculated in one of the strains, repeat fitness calculation with a less strict set of thresholds.\n",
    "- Calculate the means and variance of the DFEs for each population, also estimate error in the mean and variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "- fitness_gene_corrected: (genes x libraries x 2 replicates) inverse-variance weighted average of fitness effect of disrupting gene at insertion sites in the interior\n",
    "- fitness_relaxed: (genes x libraries x 2 replicates) same as above except I calculate fitness effects for genes using relaxed thresholds\n",
